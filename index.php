		* Instantiate a class
		* Classes are the blueprints/templates of php objects.

		* something called: instantiation.
		*
		* When you instantiate a class, you create an instance of 
		* it â€¦ thus creating the object.
		*
		* In other words, instantiation is the process of 
		* creating an instance of an object in memory. What 
		* memory? The serverâ€™s memory of course!
